/**
 * @title IVault
 * @notice Interface defining core methods, constants, and errors for vault contracts.
 * Includes events, data structures, functions, and permissions required for managing the vault.
 * @dev Main contract of the system managing interactions between users, administrators, and operators.
 *      System parameters are set within the corresponding contract - VaultConfigurator.
 *      Upon deposit, LP tokens are issued to users based on asset valuation by oracles.
 *      Deposits are made through the deposit function, where a deposit can only be made in underlyingTokens and
 *      only at the specified ratiosOracle ratio. Deposits can be paused by setting the isDepositLocked flag.
 *
 *      Withdrawals can occur through two scenarios:
 *          - Regular withdrawal via the registerWithdrawal function and emergency withdrawal via the emergencyWithdraw function.
 *          In a regular withdrawal, the user registers a withdrawal request, after which the operator must perform a series of operations
 *          to ensure there are enough underlyingTokens on the vault's balance to fulfill the user's request. Subsequently, the operator must call
 *          the processWithdrawals function. If a user's request is not processed within the emergencyWithdrawalDelay period, the user can perform an emergency withdrawal.
 *          Note! In this case, the user may receive less funds than entitled by the system, as this function only handles ERC20 tokens in the system.
 *          Therefore, if the system has a base asset that is not represented as an ERC20 token, the corresponding portion of the funds will be lost by the user.
 *
 *      It is assumed that the main system management will occur through calls to delegateModules via delegateCalls on behalf of the operator.
 *      For this to be possible, certain conditions must be met:
 *          - From the validator's perspective, two conditions must be met:
 *              1. The caller must have the right to call the delegateCall function with the corresponding data parameter.
 *              2. The contract itself must be able to call the function on the delegateModule with the specified data.
 *          - From the configurator's perspective, the called module must have the appropriate approval - isDelegateModuleApproved.
 *
 *      If external calls need to be made, the externalCall function is used, for the execution of which a similar set of properties exists:
 *          - From the validator's perspective, two conditions must be met:
 *              1. The caller must have the right to call the externalCall function with the corresponding data parameter.
 *              2. The contract itself must be able to call the function on the external contract with the specified data.
 *          - From the configurator's perspective, the called contract must NOT have isDelegateModuleApproved permission.
 *
 *      Vault also has the functionality of adding and removing underlyingTokens, as well as tvlModules.
 *      For this purpose, the following functions are available, which can only be called by the vault's admin:
 *          - addToken
 *          - removeToken
 *          - addTvlModule
 *          - removeTvlModule
 *      Upon calling removeToken, it is checked that the underlyingTvl function for the specified token returns a zero value. Otherwise, the function reverts with a NonZeroValue error.
 *      It is important to note that there is no such check when calling removeTvlModule, so when updating parameters, sequential execution of a transaction to remove the old and add the new tvlModule is implied.
